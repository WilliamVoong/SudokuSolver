The plan

1.  create a linked list of every coordinate that contains zero, when creating a member, also get the valid numbers and the size.
2.  traverse the list from beginiing to end
3.  if number is valid move to next. 
4.  if number is not valid , check next next valid number for that coordinate
5.  if all valid number fails for that coordinate, set the counter to 0, move to previous coordinate, and get the next valid number for 
    that coordinate. repeat from 3.
