By eliminiating unvalid values in the beginning of the execution, we lessen the combinations we need to try with the algorithm. 
However, what if we eliminate unvalid values in  real time with the back-track algorithm? 
I.e if we put in a number in the coordinate. Eliminate all the nodes for that value, in the row, column, and box -> then proceed with normal iteration with back track.
