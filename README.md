# SudokuSolver
Sudoku solver in console. In this implementation of the sudokusolver i used a double linkedlist to store its solvable values and coordinates.
The program tries  all valid values and used backtracking whenever a possible solution can't be find for a coordinate. 
The program only fails if the sudoku is unsolvable, as it tries every single combination of valid values for all coordinates. 





Demonstration of it solving one of the "hardest sudoku puzzle".
