# SudokuSolver
Sudoku solver in console. In this implementation of the sudokusolver i used a linkedlist to store its solvable values and coordinates and used backtracking whenever a possible solution couldnt be find. 
The program only fails if the sudoku is unsolvable, as it tries every single combination of valid values for all coordinates.
