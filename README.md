# SudokuSolver
Sudoku solver in console. In this implementation of the sudokusolver i used a linkedlist to store its solvable values and coordinates.
The program tries  all valid values and used backtracking whenever a possible solution couldnt be . 
The program only fails if the sudoku is unsolvable, as it tries every single combination of valid values for all coordinates.
